1. Listen for extra details - it will be needed to solve the problem/ or, break the BCR & solve it optimally for the special info
2. Examplify - Very Crucial

Solution & Optimization Technique:
----------------------------------
1.Remove BUD
	B -> Bottleneck
	U -> Unnecessary work 
	D -> Duplicate Work

2. DIY -> Don't think of an algo think how would you do it manually & implement that => thats your algo :)

3.Simplify & Generalize => when it's a messy information like jerseys with number instead of number.

4. Base Case Build: => DP like cases / Divide & Conquer

5. Data Structure Brainstorm => Iterate & try different data structure see it implicitly solves or reduces the problem.
