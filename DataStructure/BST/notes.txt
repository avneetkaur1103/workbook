Construct BST from its given level order traversal => Just construct the bst with level order as input sequence => as in level order root is captured before child and in case of BST if root is placed right children will take it proper place because of key property.

Check if each internal node of a BST has exactly one child:
    nextDiff = pre[i] - pre[i+1]; 
    lastDiff = pre[i] - pre[size-1]; 
    if (nextDiff*lastDiff > 0)

[IMP]Check if the given array can represent Level Order Traversal of Binary Search Tree
Do a level-order traversal w.r.t levelarray. Uses queue to store the root and find it's left and right child in levelorder array, add the childs to the queue as found.
