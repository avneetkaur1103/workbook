parent_index = (index - 1) >> 1

_siftup(pos)/heapify(pos) -> The child indices of heap index pos are already heaps, and we want to make a heap at index pos too.
_siftdown(startpos, pos) -> 'heap' is a heap at all indices >= startpos, except possibly for pos.  pos is the index of a leaf with a possibly out-of-order value.  Restore the heap invariant.

Problem with many binary search implementation:
int mid = (low + high) / 2 => leads to overflow for large values
use below instead
int mid = low + ((high - low) / 2);

Sorting waveform:
1) Traverse all even positioned elements of input array, and do following.
….a) If current element is smaller than previous odd element, swap previous and current.
….b) If current element is smaller than next odd element, swap next and current.

K-th smallest => Quick prtition => Avg O(n) / Worst O(n^2)
