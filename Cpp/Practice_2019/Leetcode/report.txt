Strategy tomorrow:
------------------
Take a step back rewrite question in your own word with an example.
Ask clearfying question and improve problem statement => 5 - 10 min?
=> Proposing solution 
	=> Strategy 1: => BF soln & test case run & complexity -> 5 min
	=> Strategy 2: => optimized algo/ complexity |test run => 5 min | code => 25-30 min 
Test code => variable / indexes / syntax / test run => 5 min
