""" Given an unsorted array of integers, sort the array into a wave like array.
An array â€˜arr[0..n-1]â€™ is sorted in wave form if arr[0] >= arr[1] <= arr[2] >= arr[3] <= arr[4] >= 
Idea: pick even places to be max of it's adjecent, swap if it isn't alreday => doesn't change previously visited triplet invarient
